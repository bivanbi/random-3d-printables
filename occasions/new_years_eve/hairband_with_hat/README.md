# New Years Eve Headband with Hat

It does not necessarily require a multicolor 3D printer, as the
year number and message are protruding from the hat surface,
and so printing can be paused and filament replaced by hand at
the appropriate layer(s).

It can also be painted by hand with acrylic paint.
